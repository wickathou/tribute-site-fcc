                    <h1>His history</h1>
                    <p>
                        Yang was born on January 13, 1975, in Schenectady, New York. His parents were from Taiwan and immigrated to the U.S. in the 1960s. They met while they were both in graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        His father graduated with a Ph.D. in physics and worked in the research labs of IBM and General Electric, generating over 69 patents in his career. His mother graduated with a master's degree in statistics and became a systems administrator at a local university. Yang has an older brother, Lawrence, who is a psychology professor.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Yang's family settled in Westchester County, New York, where Yang grew up. He described being bullied and called racial slurs by classmates while attending public school. He later wrote, "Perhaps as a result, I've always taken pride in relating to the underdog or little guy or gal".
                        <br>
                        <br>                        
                        Yang later attended Phillips Exeter Academy, an elite boarding school in New Hampshire. Yang graduated from Exeter in 1992 and went on to attend Brown University, where he majored in economics and political science and graduated in 1996. He then attended Columbia Law School, earning a Juris Doctor in 1999.

                            Yang's candidacy began on November 6, 2017, when he filed with the Federal Election Commission to participate in the Democratic primaries. He is running on the slogan "Humanity First". According to BBC, Yang "is one of the first and most recognizable East Asian-Americans in history to run for president". He has stated that he hopes his "campaign can inspire Asian Americans to be engaged in politics." If nominated, he would become the first Asian American to serve as any major party's presidential candidate, and if elected, he would become the first Asian-American president.

                            Yang's campaign has been called a "longshot" by several media outlets, including Fox News, Washington Examiner, and Vox. In early 2019, Yang appeared on several noted outlets and podcasts, including The Joe Rogan Experience, The Breakfast Club, The Ben Shapiro Show, and Tucker Carlson Tonight.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Yang's appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience has been credited as a major turning point in his campaign. Several media sources have also attributed Yang's rise in notability to his large group of online supporters, who informally refer to themselves as the Yang Gang and have made a large number of Internet memes about Yang and his campaign.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Following his sudden rise in notability, Yang attracted the interest of some prominent alt-right figures and many users of /pol/, a forum on 4chan that is notorious for its alt-right politics. Yang himself has denounced any support from the alt-right.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In an interview with The New York Times, Yang said that he is "getting support from quarters [he] wouldn't have expected"; regarding support from the alt-right in particular, he said "It's uncomfortable. They're antithetical to everything I stand for." Yang has stated that he was confused by the support he has from the alt-right, because he doesn't "look much like a white nationalist"

The story was reported by numerous media outlets, including The Independent, The Hill, and Washington Examiner. Writing for CNN, Chris Cillizza praised Yang, saying that Yang's crying "is a good thing. I've long advocated that politicians showing emotion is something we need more of (not less of) in our politics and our culture."
